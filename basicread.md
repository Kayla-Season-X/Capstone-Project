### Detailed HTML Explanation:
- A external link to change the fonts on the entire webpage
```html
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Host+Grotesk:ital,wght@0,300..800;1,300..800&family=Roboto+Condensed:ital,wght@0,100..900;1,100..900&family=Tuffy:ital,wght@0,400;0,700;1,400;1,700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
```
- A external styles sheet to change the styles in the `head` section of the HTML document naned `styles.css`.
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
```
- `body` with an id named (`body`) to change the theme styles.
```html
<body id="body">
```
- A `header` tag which is used to define the (`header`) section of the webpage
```html
    <header id="header">
        <h1>üëæü§ñCharacter Explorer üê±‚Äçüèçüê±‚Äçüë§</h1>
        <p> (Anime, Marvel, DC) </p>
        <button id="theme">Toggle Theme</button>
        <br>
        <nav>
            <input type="text" placeholder="Search character..." id="searchInput">
            <button>Search</button>
        </nav>
    </header>
```
- `header` tag holds the "title", `button` "toggle theme", and the `nav` section.

- `container` holds both `sub-containers`'s. This holds where the gallery is going to be.
```html
<div id="container">
            <div id="sub-container">
                <p>Search History</p>
                <p></p>
                <button id="clearButton">Clear Search</button>
                <br>
            </div>
            <div id="sub-container-2">
            <main  id="display" class="content">

            </main>
            </div>
        </div>
```
- `footer` section holds the `form` section which allows you to add a charcter to the gallery.

### Key CSS Features

- **Universal Styles**: A universal sign `*` used to create a specifc set of terms for the whold webpage.
```css
*{
    margin:0;
    font-family: "Tuffy", sans-serif;
    font-weight: 400;
    font-style: normal;
}
```
1.  Applies a specific `font-family`, `font-weight`, and `font-style`.
2.  Sets margin to 0.

 **Root Styles**: Uses `root` to create a specific set of colors for the `toggleTheme()` function.
```css
:root{
    --header-bg: white;
    --shadow:blue;
    --body-color: black;
    --body-bg:rgb(209, 209, 209);
    --button:lightgrey;
    --button-color:black;
    --button-hover:darkgrey;
    --button-hover-color:blue;
    --sub-container-bg:white;

    color: var(--body-color);
    background-color: var(--body-bg);
}
```

```css
header{
    background-color: var(--header-bg); text-align:center;
    padding:0.5em;
    box-shadow: 3px 3px 3px var(--shadow);
    font-weight:bold;
}
header h1{
    margin-bottom:0;
}
header p{
    font-style: italic;
}
button{
    background-color: var(--button);
    color:var(--button-color);
    border:none;
    width:130px;
    height: 25px;
    border-radius: 100px;
}
button:hover{
    transition: ease-in 0.7s;
    background-color: var(--button-hover);
    color:var(--button-hover-color);
    font-weight: bold;
    cursor:grabbing;
}
header input{
    width:50vw;
    margin-top:1em;
}
```
- **Header Styles**: `header` styles is used to set the `background-color`, `color`, `padding`, and `box-shadow`. 
- Sets up the styles for the title (`h1`), (`p`) tag, `button` (`:hover`), and `input`.

```css
.content{
    display:flex;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
}
.character-card{
    display: flex;
    margin:1.2em;
    max-width:650px;
    color:black;
    height: 330px;
    text-align: center;
    background-color: var(--card-bg);
    box-shadow: 3px 5px 5px var(--shadow); 
    border-radius: 10px;
}
.character-card img{
    width:150px;
    height: 300px; 
    margin:1em;
    border-radius: 10px;
}
.character-info{
    overflow: scroll;
}
.character-info.hidden{
    display: none;
}
section{
    padding:0em;
    margin:0.5em;
}
#sub-container-2{
    background-color: var(--sub-container-bg2);
    margin-left:0.5em;
    box-shadow: 3px 5px 5px var(--shadow);
    overflow-x: scroll;
    height:450px;
}
```

- Sets the `background-color`, `box-shadow`, and `height` for `sub-container` and `sub-container-2`.
## JavaScript Functionality
The JavaScript code handles all the dynamic behavior of the Task Manager
### Script File
Creates the `greetUser()` and the `toggleTheme()`.
```javascript
function greetUser(){
    const username = prompt("What is your name?");
    if (username === document.cookie.includes(`${username}`)){
        document.cookie = `visitedBefore = true`;
        const expireDate = new Date();
        expireDate.setDate(expireDate.getDate()+7);
        document.cookie = `visitedBefore = true; expires=${expireDate.toUTCString()}; path=/`;
        alert("üëãWelcome back. we have missed you!!");
    }else{
            alert("Hello!! Welcome to Character Explorer üëã");
            document.cookie = `${username}`;
            const expireName = new Date();
            expireName.setDate(expireName.getDate()+30);
            document.cookie = `${username}; expires=${expireName.toUTCString()}; path=/`;
    }
    }
greetUser();

const themeBtn = document.getElementById('theme');

if(localStorage.getItem('theme') === "dark"){
    document.body.classList.add('dark')
}

themeBtn.addEventListener('click', toggleTheme)

function toggleTheme(){
    document.body.classList.toggle('dark')
    if(document.body.classList.contains('dark')){
        localStorage.setItem('theme', 'dark')

    }else{

        localStorage.setItem('theme', 'light')
    }
}
```
1. **Function `greetUser()`**: this function asks the user their name and create a cookie using `document.cookie`, the function than sets an expiration date and greets the user with either "üëãWelcome back. we have missed you!!" if they have visited or "Hello!! Welcome to Character Explorer üëã" if they have not.

```javascript
function greetUser(){
    const username = prompt("What is your name?");
    if (username === document.cookie.includes(`${username}`)){
        document.cookie = `visitedBefore = true`;
        const expireDate = new Date();
        expireDate.setDate(expireDate.getDate()+7);
        document.cookie = `visitedBefore = true; expires=${expireDate.toUTCString()}; path=/`;
        alert("üëãWelcome back. we have missed you!!");
    }else{
            alert("Hello!! Welcome to Character Explorer üëã");
            document.cookie = `${username}`;
            const expireName = new Date();
            expireName.setDate(expireName.getDate()+30);
            document.cookie = `${username}; expires=${expireName.toUTCString()}; path=/`;
    }
    }
greetUser();
```
2. **Function `toggleTheme()`**:
```javascript
const themeBtn = document.getElementById('theme');

if(localStorage.getItem('theme') === "dark"){
    document.body.classList.add('dark')
}

themeBtn.addEventListener('click', toggleTheme)
```
Checks the `localStorage` on if the theme is `dark` or not.
```javascript
function toggleTheme(){
    document.body.classList.toggle('dark')
    if(document.body.classList.contains('dark')){
        localStorage.setItem('theme', 'dark')

    }else{

        localStorage.setItem('theme', 'light')
    }
}
```
Uses the previous `eventListener` function and removes or adds `dark` theme.

### Render File:
This creates the `renderCharacters(characters)` function, `expandDiv(parent)` function, `initializeSearch()` function, `searchCharacters(searchTerm)` function, `saveSearchTerm(term)` function, and `addCharacter(event)` function. 
```javascript
const character=[
    {
        image:"obito.png",
        name:"Obito Uchiha",
        show:"Naruto, Naruto Shipudden",
        from:"Anime, Manga",
        year:"2000-2023",
        occupation:"Ninja",
        gender:"Male",
        role:"Villian",
        bio:"Obito Uchiha is a character from the Naruto anime and manga series created by Masashi Kishimoto. He was originally a kind-hearted and idealistic member of the Uchiha clan and a teammate of Kakashi Hatake and Rin Nohara under Minato Namikaze (the future Fourth Hokage). Obito was thought to have died during a mission, but he survived and was manipulated by the villain Madara Uchiha. After witnessing Rin‚Äôs death, Obito‚Äôs worldview changed drastically, and he adopted a darker path. He took on the identity of 'Tobi' and became one of the main antagonists, playing a key role in the Akatsuki organization and initiating the Fourth Great Ninja War. Despite his actions, Obito's story is ultimately one of tragedy and redemption. He realizes the consequences of his choices and sacrifices himself to help Naruto and the Allied Shinobi Forces defeat the true final enemy.",

A brilliant botanist, Pamela Isley was transformed into Poison Ivy after being poisoned by a combination of toxins, which gave her the ability to control plants and exude deadly pheromones. With her newfound powers, she becomes an eco-terrorist, using her abilities to manipulate plants and toxins to achieve her goals. Though often depicted as an adversary to Batman, Ivy's motivations are more complex, as she views her actions as a means of protecting the environment and punishing those who harm nature. Over time, Poison Ivy's character has evolved from a straightforward villain into a more nuanced figure, at times acting as an antihero. She is often portrayed as deeply connected to nature and has a strong sense of moral outrage about the destruction of the planet. In various storylines, Ivy has allied with characters like Harley Quinn and even fought alongside Batman when their interests align. Her complex relationship with environmentalism, her tragic backstory, and her unpredictable nature make her one of Gotham's most compelling and multifaceted characters, balancing between villainy and moments of unexpected compassion.",

```javascript
function renderCharacters(characters){
    console.log('renderCharacters called with', characters.length, 'characters');
    const display = document.getElementById('display');
    if(!display){
        console.error('Display not found');
        return;
    }
    display.innerHTML = '';
    if(characters.length === 0){
        console.log('No characters found, showing empty message');
        display.innerHTML = '<p>No characters found üì≠</p>';
        return;
    }
    characters.forEach(character =>{
        if(!character ||typeof character.name !== 'string'){
            console.warn('Invalid country object:', character);
            return;
        }
        const characterDiv =  document.createElement('div');
        characterDiv.className = 'character-card';
        characterDiv.innerHTML=`
                <img onclick="expandDiv(this.parentElement)"src="${character.image || ''}" alt="Image of ${character.name}" class = "character-img">
                <div class="character-info hidden">
            <h3>${character.name}</h3>
            <h4>${character.show}</h4>
            <h4>From a ${character.from}</h4>

    });

    console.log(`Successfully rendered ${characters.length} characters`);
}
```

    if(!searchInput){
        console.error('Search input element not found');
        return;
    }
    searchInput.addEventListener('input', function(){
        const searchTerm = this.value.trim().toLowerCase();
        console.log('Input event detected, search term:', searchTerm);

        if(searchTerm !== ''){
            searchCharacters(searchTerm);
        }
    });
    searchInput.addEventListener('keydown', function(e){
        if(e.key === 'Enter'){
            const searchTerm = searchInput.value.trim().toLowerCase();
            console.log('Enetr key pressed for search term:', searchTerm);

            if(searchTerm !== ''){
                searchCharacters(searchTerm);

            };
        };
    });
};
```

        return;
    }

    if(searchTerm === ''){
        console.log('Empty search term, showing all characters');
        renderCharacters(character);
        return;
    }

    });
    console.log(`Found ${filteredCharaters.length} charcaters matching "${searchTerm}"`);

    renderCharacters(filteredCharaters);
}
```
5. **searchTerm()**: This function saves the search in the `localStorage`.
```javascript
function saveSearchTerm(term){
    let searchHistory = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('searchHistory')) || [];

    if(searchHistory.length >= 10){
        searchHistory.shift();

    let newCharacter = {
        image:imageInput,
        name:cnameInput,
        show:showInput,
        from:bookInput,
